**Normal Mode**

You have to write a program that, when run, asks the user to input some text. It can be a word, a sentence, or multiple sentences. After it is entered, your program will let the user know if it is a palindrome or not.

Letter casing and punctuation do not matter when testing a palindrome. All of the following are valid palindromes:

In addition to the above requirements for Normal Mode have your program able to determine if the below phrases pass.

- A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal: Panama!
